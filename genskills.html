									<h3> Conclusions from burning glass data</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p><h5>Davin</h5>
									I’m very pleased with the job that i’ve chosen and its current rank amongst the list, I would still keep my current choice due to my fondness of programming and team building. After some thought I believe the only hurdle I would face are the skills required to achieve my ideal job especially after understanding the importance of each ranked skill through the data provided. In my opinion I have no problems with the general skills required for my ideal job. My goal would ultimately be to reach a senior level, Senior Java Developer, however years of experience would be required before I am able to obtain it.
									<h5>Daniel</h5>
									I was quite surprised with the ranking difference between full stack developer and front end developer, ranked 6 and 17 respectively. The job is in high demand right now meaning that there is no shortage of companies wanting to hire these types of developers.
									Overall, I am happy with the ranking and skills required as they align with my expectations.
									<h5>Emmanuel</h5>
									My opinion has not changed as i am quite familiar with the Oracle database scene, also, the ranking which represents availability is actually tied in to various other job roles which are related to skills obtained via the Oracle certifications. Also, many job postings exist for the software developer genre which is also a skill obtained from Oracle PL/SQL.
									<h5>Maryam</h5>
									Very surprised to find out that graphic designers are ranked second, I feel even more motivated to attain a position in this field compared to before and the requirements seem a lot more doable.
									<h5>Benjamin</h5>
									Not that happy with the list. Might change to Graphics design since it is an integration of IT and graphic arts which is a skill i have. but if in future if it appears on the list i will be quite happy and go for it.
									<h5>Hayden</h5>
									I’m very surprised with the ranking difference between Mobile app developer and other developer. Since required IT skills and Generic skills appropriates to the ideal job, my opinion has not been changed  but through the burning glass data I will be able to have broad-minded in job selection.I will be interested in some other jobs such as designer, or engineer.
