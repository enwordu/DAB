									<p>Cloud computing is a term referring to the ability of resources which include servers, databases, storage, networking and software to be shared via the internet (Microsoft 2018). The term “cloud computing” was coined by google developer, Eric Schmidt, but the practical concept of resource sharing via the internet is quite new so companies are still coming to terms with the fact that their worries have been reduced seeing all the benefits to be had from cloud computing. The first area that is trending now in the cloud age I would say is the server section, previously a company that needed a website had to go through strenuous tasks like getting a server room, hosting their private server and they also had to pay a systems administrator to maintain the services offered by the server and this basically had to be done in situ. Enter the cloud era now all it takes to host a business website is to know a website that has a server cloud service where they sell server space and maintenance at a cheaper rate.</p>
									<p>Online mobile and web applications also profited in the same vein as database services, programming platform and even required software can now be leased out on a cloud platform where you only get the needed space and resources as you need it and not having to employ the plethora of previously required staff. Another trending sector that is deeply into the cloud is the office administration sector, what with office applications being pushed to the cloud, file movement and processing is now as easy as editing a file online and all necessary administrators get the updates in real time. According to Bain & Company, the IT cloud sector has the potential to generate $400B by 2020(medium.com 2017), this trend emphasizes the fact that major industries and even small start-ups are taking advantage of the ease provided by cloud computing.</p>
									<p>Presently cloud computing is grouped into 3 main categories, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS which mean Infrastructure as a service, Platform as a service and Software as a service respectively. Infrastructure as a service where IT infrastructure such as servers or networking is provisioned on a pay as you use basis, this is quite vast as it encompasses the software or platform on the devices. Platform as a service is a developer necessity as application development platforms can be hosted online and shared between a group of developers which will give them the ability to synchronize their work, test for bugs and run updates in real time. 
									Software as a service is the most common of them all as this includes all office applications and various other online tools that can be used only for the cost of an account, as the name implies, this cloud service entails provisioning shareable software applications online(Microsoft 2018).In the foreseeable future devices will be developed to take advantage of and key into the cloud computing platform, this might range from IoT devices to basic office appliances. Existing technology also points to this trend as driverless cars become more prevalent and resources get more limited, the idea of sharing resources will be a very welcome option if only for the fact that it prevents resource wastage.</p>

									<h2>EFFECTS OF CLOUD COMPUTING</h2>
									<p>Cloud computing essentially saves resources as the sharing connotes a use of parts that otherwise would be dormant. This is likely to impact industry and users as the benefits seem to be far-reaching. I will enumerate the possible case scenarios for and against IT industrialists, service providers and end users.<h3>END USERS</h3>Cloud computing is full of good potential for end users as they basically get the good side of the pie which includes reduced costs, availability, inherent backup of files and ubiquitous access to data, applications and required resources(Microsoft 2018).<h3>IT INDUSTRIALISTS</h3> While the potential to reach more users arising from online provisioning is inherent in cloud computing, the IT industrial giants like Microsoft might go slower on implementation of cloud platforms as this means a cut to licensing of products. Take office for example, the proprietary Microsoft Office product was usually licensed and once one got a copy and a key he had it for life until he needed an update. 
									Enter office 365 an online office platform that comes with a yearly subscription which might not level up with the licensing since it lasts for only a year and costs approximately the same. If Microsoft makes the price to expensive they lose users who with the coming of cloud computing are aware of various free platforms that offer the same service.<h3>SERVICE PROVIDERS</h3> This are the service provisioners or those configure and maintain the cloud services, they include cloud technicians and specialists. This group sees a bulk of the profit, with major technology universities and analysts predicting the boom and general shift of computing to the cloud, little wonder this group stands to benefit the most.</p>

									<h2>PERSONAL IMPACT</h2>
									<p>Personally, I got involved in cloud computing in 2015, I was previously a programmer and a network designer but due to shifting trends in the IT world I decided to diversify into the data field. Enter Oracle Database, after I achieved my associate level certification in the same technology but the 11g version I researched the professional level certifications and I came across the most recent iteration which is the Oracle Database 12c (the C stands for clouds). The logic of the necessity of the clouds iteration is for large organisations who have lots of branches nationally and maybe internationally. 
									Previously the large companies had to buy the expensive software for every unit of operation but with the 12c a single software can be used which is known an the “container database” and it provisions subsets known as “pluggable databases” which can then be allocated to each branch or unit of operation. This single step has helped me as a database administrator as I no longer need to work on different databases, logging on and off severally and trying to get access and rights to a database, now everything can be comfortably done from the headquarters or virtually any authorised service point. Another way cloud computing has affected me personally is in the use of office applications for version control and team projects which I came upon during my studies in RMIT. I hate to think about a world without cloud computing in this regard, just the thought of the time, energy and resources saved by the ability of a group to edit a file all at the same time online is mind boggling as normally one would have to basically rely on the independent available time of the group members.
									</p>
									<p>Furthermore, my family would also benefit from cloud computing as the family business would be able to link all our holdings in a central location improving security and recordkeeping especially for financial records and if we are to diversify from the real estate sector into say medicine, IT or oil we would have an existing system to merge into thereby saving more resources.</p>
