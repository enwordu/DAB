									<h2>Interviewee: Edward </h2>
									<h3>What kind of work is done by the IT Professional?</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>Edward worked as a service delivery manager at an IT consultancy firm. He was responsible for the technical aspect of project management services. For example, if a large company wanted to perform an overhaul of the existing IT infrastructure, you would be looking at upgrading thousands of devices with a team of 10 professionals. It is about managing the resources that are available to you to reach the desired outcome. The role is heavily deadline-driven with weekly progress reports given to clients and management.</p>
									<p>One of the larger projects tackled was for Visy, the recycling, waste management and manufacturing company. Its main focus is the recycling and production of plastic and cardboard goods for business and individual consumption.
									The goal of the project was to refresh 6000 users over 9 months at over 100 sites.
									This, very broadly, involved; 
									<ul><li>Preparing new sites for upgrade, depending on purpose.</li>
									<li>Managing the logistics of getting the new equipment out to the sites.</li>
									<li>Install new equipment at sites and install all required software.</li>
									<li>Manage the logistics of removing old equipment from sites.</li>
									<li>Performing data sanitization on old equipment to make sure that no data has leaked.</li></ul>
									</p>
									<p>During Edwards’s time as a Service Delivery Manager he did not specifically have any qualification. It was purely through experience, a ‘Learn on the go’ aspect. He was able to obtain experience through working as a;
									<ul><li>Repair technician from various PC Companies</li>
									<li>On-site service technician</li>
									<li>Service manager of RAM Workshops</li>
									<li>Service Delivery Manager (SDM)</li></ul>
									Qualifications however has changed since then to a more educational role with degrees as requirements. A degree currently can be seen as a rite of passage, which hinders various job titles to be obtainable without having first completed a title beforehand.

									<h3>What kinds of people does the IT Professional interact with?
									(Are there other IT Professionals? Clients? Investors? The General Public?)
									</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>In IT today, the need to communicate effectively, with a range of people, is a critical skill. A service delivery manager is no different.
									They have to deal with;
									<ul><li><h5>Clients: </h5>To understand their needs, requirements and any other bits of information pertinent to the project.</li>
									<br />
									<li><h5>Management: </h5>To deliver progress reports and update on estimated completion times. This may include any foreseeable roadblocks as well.</li>
									<br />
									<li><h5>Warehouse staff: </h5>To coordinate the logistic of moving physical equipment to and from sites and suppliers.</li>
									<br />
									<li><h5>Workshop technicians: </h5>To discuss progress of installations, upgrades, issues, etc…</li>
									<br />
									<li><h5>Client’s IT team: </h5>Training and provide tools/expertise to be able to manage new or upgraded IT system.</li>
									<br />
									<li><h5>End Users: </h5>When special requirements have been added, interaction with end users might be required to better understand how to deliver these requirements to the user.</li>
									<br />
									<li><h5>Others: </h5>
									<ul><li>Telco’s</li>
									<li>Contractors</li>
									<li>more</li></ul>
									</li></ul></p>
									<p>A deeper analysis of the good and the bad can be generally classified into three groups;
									<h5>The Good</h5>
									<ul><li>Client: These people want you to succeed at your job, generally due to the fact that they pay you to deliver.</li>
									<li>End Users: These people are generally always happy to replace old equipment with something more current.</li></ul>
									<h5>The Bad</h5>
									<ul><li>Client: Things can turn quite sour if expectations are not met, and plans go astray.</li>
									<li>End Users: If the end product is not what was expected, these people can raise complaints.</li>
									<li>Company Personnel: Similarly to clients if the team does not cooperate and communicate effectively, complications can arise which leads to conflict</li></ul>
									</p>

									<h3>Where does the IT Professional spend most of their time?</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>As the job title indicates, management is involved. This means that majority of the work is done away from the desk. If you compare it to someone who is a software engineer or support technician, they will most likely spend most of their time on the screen.
									SDM’s spend majority of their time on the floor at a Clients site, overseeing smooth project progression. This allows them to deal with any issues immediately to prevent any major delays. In addition, time is spent at warehouses (logistics), configuration centres and meetings with both clients and management.
									Due to the highly mobile nature of the job, laptops, phones and other portable tech are used to perform any administrative and/or operational duties on the move.
									</p>
									<p>The most difficult aspect of this type of work is being able to manage expectations between clients and management.
									In truth, it is more akin to a double-edged sword. For example, if Group A expected milestone 1 to be completed in 4 days and you were able to get it done in two, they would be very happy. This turn of event could potentially result in higher expectation in the future. On the other hand, if a project took 6 days to complete instead of the expected 4 Group A would be quite upset.
									Edward’s key to dealing with managing expectations comes down to proactive communication, to talk to people in an honest and direct manner about any roadblocks preventing him from delivering as expected.

									<h3>Overall, what can you say about your experience within the IT industry?</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>At end with we asked Edward whether he had any advice or comments about the IT industry he could provide for us or other younger generations. And in quotes;
									“Never stop learning. Don’t get stuck in a rut. Don’t assume your skills are enough, go out of your way and learn more, challenge yourself and always push for the next thing. Make an effort to do more.”
									“It’s been entertaining, and there is lots to know. You cannot know everything, as much as you would like to, it is impossible to know everything. And some people will act like they know everything – they are the people to watch out for since they can be trouble”
