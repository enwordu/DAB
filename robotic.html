									<h2>What does it do?</h2>
									<p>Robotics is a very broad subject. To summarise the purpose of a robot is to automatically aid and carry out a series of actions that is predetermined by a program. The application for robots are infinite with the only limitation being of the developer’s imagination. The size of the machine will also vary depending on its intended use, from something as small as a nanite or something as large as a prosthetic limb. Recently, robots have begun to meld with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in hopes to create a sentient being. Although the goal will require many years of labour, recent breakthroughs has shown promising results. There are two main robots that has been released to the public recently; ‘Buddy’ a home assistant robot made by Blue Frog, and ‘Sophia’, a humanoid robot made by David Hanson from Hanson Robotics. Buddy is a robot that aids its owner by completing simple tasks automatically or via voice command. It’s intricate AI system allows the robot to show various levels of emotions and simulate human-like behaviour towards its owners. Buddy’s main purpose is still to give ease of access to multiple appliances or programs connected through the internet.</p>
									<p>Sophia on the other hand simulates human-like conversations. David Hanson, creator of Sophia, was fixated on the ability for machinery to display intelligence called the ‘Turing Test’. He had the intention to create a robot that would perfectly blend into conversations without the receiver realizing that he or she is conversing with a machine. Although the goal is to create a sentient robot able to think for itself, multiple reporters argue that ultimately Sophia is a robot with a large database of events. Head of Facebook's A.I. team Yann Lecun comments that Sophia is basically a puppet that outputs biased answers depending on the information stored within its memory.</p>
									<p>Robots as a whole already take up the majority of our lives, from something as simple as a vending machine to as intricate as self-driving cars. Although some aspects still require testing, the majority of robots already integrates itself with our daily lifestyle. Due to our unification through the world wide web or internet, robots are able to play a large role in simplifying mundane tasks. Predictions over the near future on how robots will function varies within each industry. Ironically with machines taking over various jobs, the demand for hands on workers to integrate such machinery into certain locations will shoot up. Industries to be most affected by advancements in robotics are; Health, Security, and Industry related automation.
									In the medical industry, robots can be seen replacing missing limbs or key organs from various individuals, allowing them to perform tasks once again without the aid of others. Surgeons have also opted to use robots to perform intricate procedures on patients where regular human hands dare not. Security wise robots have actually integrated into multiple modern households acting as a guard through cameras or motion sensors. And in the near future, there is no industry that will work efficiently without the use of robotics.
									Although humanity has achieved great lengths in the field of robotics, there are still uncharted regions which lean heavily on ethical issues. These issues can slow or even halt progress in regards to the development of robotics. Some problems range from the frightening thought of combining humans with the precision of robots to the use and abuse of robotics for warfare. Even if these fearsome ideas linger in the minds of many, any step towards the development of robotics will surely contribute to the big picture of the future that we see in fiction themed media today.

									<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>
									<p>Robots have already replaced multiple roles that people once had. The simpler and more repetitive the task is, the more likely a robot will be able to take place. A simple example would be the toll booth on the highway, which was originally manned by a staff member whose job was to exchange money, is now a simple robot that detects as you pass through a sensor and deducts money automatically. Although the view of robots taking over jobs in the near future is a high possibility, we cannot deny the need for hands on or on-site staff members to ensure robots do not malfunction. As perfect and precise as they are, they are still prone to malfunction at some point in time.
									As predicted, over the next few years, no single industry will be able to function properly without the use of robots. These industries ranges from retail to healthcare of intellectual property. The simplest example that comes to mind would be at an assembly line which multiple companies have already replaced with robots. </p>
									<p>The time and space taken by a single human can be accomplished one hundred times faster and replicated with less error by an automated device. As jobs of lower tier decrease, openings within high-end requirements would increase. This would mean that in the near future to get a job would require a certain level of education.
									It was hypothesized that within approximately 25 to 30 years and with the speedy progress of robotic development, humanity will completely shift to depend on robots more than ever before. This dependency will range from jobs as simple as teaching children how to sing, to complex arithmetic breakthroughs that potentially might solve our global warming dilemma. Although this impact is foreseen to take place in the far future, the current breakthroughs found in the present shows promising results for the future of robotics.

									<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
									<p>In my opinion the majority of the population is eager to indulge in the world of robotics. Life today would be completely different if industrialisation never occurred. The development of machines will impact our daily lifestyle won’t be expressed clearly. Our lives today already depend heavily on robots and the expectation of instantaneous results. I believe that the development of robots will be such a breakthrough that its functions will merge with our lifestyle seamlessly whilst at the same time reducing the workload by eliminating the need to perform basic tasks.
									Even with eager minds willing to take up robots as a luxury, there will always be a downside to the rise of one main topic, one issue that we believe will affect the majority is privacy. With the current unification of people worldwide via the internet, which goes well with the saying “It’s a small world”, robots actions are based on user-input and can potentially be a bridge that eliminates privacy. For example, users of the ‘Buddy’ robot, are able to freely access the camera installed within the robot to view its surroundings. A simple con to this idea would be if someone was to hack the program, the intruder then would be able to view your entire house via what you thought would keep you safe.
									Even if the stakes are high, the idea of would still outweigh the bad. These cases are especially targeted towards the elderly who find constant trouble using the latest developments. By eliminating the need for a touch interface and replacing it with voice commands instead, elders would find it easier to complete simple tasks such as calling a loved one.
									In conclusion the future of robotics would definitely change the lifestyle we see today. Its affects would be large, yet blends perfectly to our lifestyle to a point where we would be unable to imagine life without machinery
