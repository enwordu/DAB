									<h2>What does it do?</h2>
									<p>The role of cybersecurity essentially is to protect the digital landscape from threats. Specifically, it aims to protect three main aspects of computer systems and these include, confidentiality, integrity and availability (Rouse, 2018). Confidentiality refers to access that is only given to people who are authorised to read certain information. An example of a data breach would be when an attacker gains access to credit card details. To maintain Integrity is to ensure that only authorized persons are able to modify data. For instance, hackers who manage to get into an individual’s email account and send emails.  And finally, Availability refers to authorized persons always having access to their data. An example of how availability may be breached is by making a website to slow and therefore unreachable.
									To maintain confidentiality, integrity and availability cybersecurity personnel use threat models to profile attackers. It outlines their possible ways of attacking by taking into account hackers’ capabilities and goals. The front line of defense to secure networks is achieved by installing firewalls which monitor incoming and outgoing traffic. This is meant to prevent unauthorized access based on a predefined set of rules. However, there are limitations, such as software vulnerabilities and ‘spoofed’ messages that bypass the predefined set of rules.
									</p>
									<p>There are several elements that constitute cybersecurity.  The first is applying countermeasures also known as application security. As mentioned above this may be installing firewalls which is a software based countermeasure, there are also physical methods of application security such as a router (Rouse, 2013) which prevents IP addresses from being traced. Information security is another element of cybersecurity aims to protect confidentiality, integrity and application of information by conducting risk management. Large companies with sensitive information often hire security teams to build ‘infospec programs’ which caters to the company’s specific security requirements, (Rouse, 2016). Some measures that these infospec programs conduct include but is not limited to, encryption key management, password policies and mantraps which is a physical form of information security. In instances where there is an unexpected incident a disaster recovery plan (DRP) is made use of to minimize the impacts of the incident (Rouse & Crocetti, 2017). 
									This aspect of cybersecurity deals with both man-made and natural disasters and includes a wide range of possible disasters within these two categories. Some examples given by Edward Haletky, a notable independent consultant includes, application failure, communication failure, data center disaster and national disaster. To combat these examples of disasters there a variety of disaster recovery plans such as a virtualized disaster recovery plan, this plan is known to be more efficient (Rouse & Crocetti, 2017) as it allows planners to view a virtual environment with virtual machines almost instantly while also allowing high availability of application recovery. Another type of disaster recovery plan is a cloud-based one. This plan is quite straightforward in that it simply consists of backing up a file in the cloud to completely replicating all files. Advantages of this plan include efficiency of space, time and costs (Rouse & Crocettie, 2017).</p>
									<p>Types of cybersecurity threats include malware, ransomware, social engineering and phishing. Malware is the most commonly known type of threat to the wider population and includes worms, viruses, trojan horses and spyware these are programs designed to harm computers. Ransomwares is a type of malware and uses encryption to lock a victim from being able to access their files and requires a payment from the user in order to regain access to their computer. Phishing is an attempt to steal sensitive information such as credit card details by sending e-mails that appear to be legitimate but are in fact fraudulent.</p>

									<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
									<p>Developments in cybersecurity for Australia are required in sectors such as healthcare, energy (electricity) and the government (government services such as Centrelink). According to the Australian Bureau of statistics $1.4 billion had been lost by Australians due to personal fraud. Developments within these areas are necessary in order to protect Australians from cyber attacks. There is a growing dependency on technology within these sectors which require more focus on strengthening cybersecurity. However, following the recent changes within the Australian government where Scott Morrison became Prime Minister there was also a change in the priority of cybersecurity for Australia. A backward change in fact. There is no longer a separate minister for cybersecurity, Morrison had stated that Peter Dutton as minister of home affairs will also include focussing on cybersecurity (Foye, 2018). This places less emphasis on the importance of cybersecurity which could be detrimental to the progression of increasing the safety of Australian citizens with growing dependency on the internet for healthcare, energy use and government services.
									For example, people who rely on healthcare have been faced with data misuse, fraud and poor patient-provider trust. If there are no steps taken forward to strengthen cybersecurity for healthcare services several social impacts can occur, such as patients fearing that their medical records being exposed and will therefore keep important information about their health status from their doctors. Attackers are also now asking for higher amounts of money from ransomware attacks, where they lock access to patient data for sums of up to $10 million. Cases such as these place patients at unease and is therefore crucial that cybersecurity is continually developed.

									<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
									<p>Personally, I am not heavily involved in healthcare in that I am not a long-term patient of any sort, so my daily life would be rather normal and ordinary. Nor am I living alone so I also have no involvement with energy services as of yet. However, as any citizen is I am involved in government services. From 2025 onwards, government services will be provided online, which will have positive impacts, such as cost efficiency and improving citizen experience. However, these positive impacts will only occur if cybersecurity is tightened. There have been previous security breaches where confidential information had been accessed by a third party with a goal for attaining citizen records. Furthermore, there is no information available about who the attackers specifically were and hence highlights the vital need for stronger cybersecurity within government services. After these attacks, the Government had taken the departments that had been targeted offline for about 2 months. If a similar attack takes place where my sensitive information had been compromised my personal life may be affected. The worst case scenario would be identity theft which would lead to money being stolen and as a university student with no job I would not be able to go about my daily life. My Centrelink payments may also be halted until online services are secure again.
									There would be more or greater impacts on my parents as they are personally involved in all three sectors that rely on cybersecurity. For instance, within the sector of energy services hackers have conducted various attacks in the past such as causing power outages. Power outages affect communities and threaten quality of life.
