									<h2>What does it do?</h2>
									<p>Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital money. Conventional currencies used today are regulated by banks and other financial institutions in order to keep its value in check so that inflation and depression are kept at bay.
									Cryptocurrencies are completely decentralised, instead relying on peer to peer networks to disseminate money. Until 2008-2009, there have been many attempts at building a centralised, digital currency system, all if which have ultimately failed.
									During the end of the 2000’s, the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was released changing what money is forever. Since then, a plethora of other currencies are now available to trade with on the open market and to spend at various outlets.
									Although cryptocurrencies offer many advantages, there is one sizeable disadvantage: volatility. The role of a regulatory body is to manage the cash rate and other metrics of a currency to avoid volatility, which ultimately adds value and strength.
									Crypto has seen huge fluctuations the last year alone with a low of $2000 USD and rising to a massive $20,000 USD, then back down to half that less than a month later. These huge changes in value make investing a high-risk-high-reward venture with few individuals taking the chance.
									</p>
									<p>Today, cryptocurrencies are worth over $9 Billion USD. Governments have had difficulty with figuring out how to regulate digital currencies due to its nature. Countries like Australia, USA and Singapore have put tax treatments in place for business and individuals
									Many people today are still in the dark as to what cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is and its possible applications. Today, more and more outlets are accepting bitcoin, and other currencies, as valid currencies that can be used. Microsoft, PayPal, Expedia, Amazon are but a few major companies accepting bitcoin as payment.
									To complement the efficacy of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology was created.
									Consider a traditional word document for a group assignment. If someone else is editing a document, you would have to wait for those changes to be saved and sent before you can do any editing.
									Recently, with services like Google docs, users are able to manipulate word documents with other people simultaneously and in real time. Also kept, is a log of changes made by users since the inception of the document.
									Similarly, blockchain technology is a digital distributed ledger that records any transaction that has value. It keeps track of these changes in objects called blocks that are added in sequential order to a blockchain.
									</p>
									<p>In order to process a transaction using blockchain technology;
									<ol><li>Someone requests a transaction to be made.</li>
									<li>That transaction is broadcast to the network.</li>
									<li>The network validates the transaction and user status.</li>
									<li>Once verified, the transaction is grouped with other transaction in a block.</li>
									<li>The block is added to the blockchain.</li>
									<li>The transaction is complete.</li></ol>
									As a result of its design, blockchain cannot; 
									<ul><li>Be maintained by a single entity as it relies on distributed databases to work.</li>
									<li>Fail to bring the whole network down. Everyone has a copy of the ledger.</li>
									<li>Be opaque and corruptible. The network is built to reconcile all transactions every 10 minutes into objects called blocks.</li></ul>
									As discussed, Blockchain Tech is a ledger that details transactions over a P2P network, most common of which have been financial transactions. However, there are many other applications of the technology that are currently out of reach.
									Capital funds, major tech companies and banks are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in start-ups working on blockchain-based services. Spotify is exploring using the tech for copyright management, IBM is building a tracking service for shipping companies and Shutterstock are experimenting with creating repos for stock images.
									In summary, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are a fairly new form of technology with few uses outside of a financial role. However, with heavy investment from large companies and growing interest in the area, it won’t be long before other applications are discovered.

									<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
									<p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency is changing the way in which people trade with one another. “In other words, it’s the first native digital medium for value, just as the internet was the first native digital medium for information. And this has big implications for business and the corporation” [Para.3, Page 1].
									A lot of the hype seen in the last decade have revolved around its impact on the financial sector but experts in the field are looking beyond, with research being conducted in fields where the change could be more profound than that in the financial sector. As indicated, technology is no longer just about disseminating knowledge, it is also about creating value.
									Consider, a massive eCommerce site like eBay, Amazon, Newegg and alike. Blockchain has the potential to allow businesses like these to develop native payment systems that do not require intermediary involvement from financial institutions, banks and others, saving in time and money.
									</p>
									<p>What about the music industry? Number of songs sold, markets, retail prices are but few of the factors that determine royalties paid to artists. Due to the intricate methods used to calculate them, making mistakes is not hard.
									Companies like Mycelia are creating smart songs, with embedded contracts, that allow artists to sell directly to consumers cutting out middlemen like Spotify, Google Music and iTunes.
									Opportunities also lie in businesses that collaborate with one another, for whatever reason. Software and tools available today require valuable and sensitive information to be shared through a third party (E.g. Trello, Google, Slack). Companies and Employees could build profiles for themselves to establish trust and credibility for collaboration, no longer requiring information to be sent through third parties.
									The effects of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain is still widely unknown with more and more possible application being discovered than ever before. Whilst only a few applications have been mentioned above, far more await.

									<h2>How will this likely affect you?</h2>
									<p>If crypto and blockchain were more widely adopted this would mean that I;
									<ul><li>Would no longer need to carry any physical money as currency would be stored in a crypto wallet.</li>
									<ul><li>As crypto is completely intangible, I would be able to pay an exact amount every time without having to worry about calculations in my head.</li>
									<li>Crypto wallets can be stored in mobile apps, pc’s and physical devices. Just don’t lose your key!</li>
									<li>Fewer items in pockets.</li></ul>
									<li>Would feel more at ease purchasing goods online.</li></ul>
									When purchasing products, it is important to me that creators get the money that I spend. After all, it is because of them and their foresight that I have decided to purchase in the first place. However, what actually trickles down to creators is a far cry from what they deserve, with service providers taking their portion. 
									As for my family, they would be able to; 
									<ul><li>Create an eCommerce site for their café, selling coffee beans that they roast onsite.</li>
									<li>Transactions would be between my parents and consumers without the need of banks.</li>
									<li>Store data in the cloud built using blockchain.</li>
									<li>More traditional services offered by Google, AWS and Oracle have been in the press over hackers obtaining sensitive client information from their services.  Consequently, Small business owners will more at ease storing data on a decentralised network.</li></ul>
