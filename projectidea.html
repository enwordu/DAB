									<h3>Overview</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>As Australia’s population grows, so does its need for robust, scalable transport infrastructure. As the federal and state governments coordinate building new roads, railways, tram lines and other transport routes. The computerised management system for using this infrastructure becomes increasingly difficult to manage.
									There are currently, six different Transport networks across the country that administer and regulate their own public transport systems. Based on a rating survey conducted by Age, on PT users, Metro scored the worst across Overall Satisfaction, Reliability, Ticketing system and Scheduling. Transperth on the other hand scored the best. For the full scoring table, please refer to Appendix 3.
									What we propose is building a centralised, cloud operated Public Transportation System that can be used by anyone at any location, provided an internet connection is available.
									</p>

									<h3>Challenges</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>We anticipate that the greatest challenge to the project will be its development but rather getting the cooperation of the Federal and State Governments.
									There are other instances were interoperability of systems has proved effective. eTags used on Brisbane Sydney can be used right here in Melbourne. Which begs the question: Why hasn’t this been done for Public Transport?
									The “National Ticketing and Tolling Working Group” was established with this very goal in mind but were ultimately road-blocked stating that “In Australia, while Perth, Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne have each selected the same card interface, there is no immediate prospect of achieving smartcard data, reader or back-end interissuer interoperability. Efforts by the National Ticketing and Tolling Working Group (NTTWG) and Standards Australia are effectively on hold while each city rolls out its own vendor-specific implementation.” [para. 34, Page 1].
									As with most ambitious projects, the potential for development becomes reality when investors show interest. The main concern will be demonstrating proof of concept without actually running tests in the real world, especially when the system that they currently use works for them
									</p>
									<p>The next greatest challenge will be implementation of the infrastructure. Given the sheer scope of the project, our only viable option would be to do it in two stages;
									<h5>Testing: </h5>In a small, metropolitan area with a Public transport system. Technologies used to develop the system will be slightly more powerful than technologies used in Implementation phase.
									<h5>Implementation: </h5>Roll out in stages,similar to the NBN in idea (not execution). Technologies used will be amongst the cheapest in order to reduce costs.
									As this solution will use Near Field Communication, a wireless technology, there may be fears as to the level of security used for these cards. These fears relate to the potential for hacking, for which we will use the latest encryption technique, and human error, such as losing a card.
									Customer service and quality is an important consideration given the number of people who would be utilising the new platform. Keeping on the good side of customer is extremely important as consumers will be more forgiving when an unplanned incident occurs i.e. Cancelled service.

									<h3>What is NFC?</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>An NFC Chip is a small device that allows transfer of data wirelessly. Its small nature and speedy communication would benefit the ‘Tap and Go’  feature of public transports we see today. The chip or tag stores data which communicates to an appropriate NFC Device, a reader or writer. Each tag is able to store data, however the size depends on the type of tag and individual capacity. NFC Chips are regarded as passive devices which means that they do not carry a power source within them. Instead they rely on the reader to provide power on the spot, the supplied power which comes from contact will provide enough time for the Chip to read and write or rewrite information depending on the data sent by the device. NFC Tags range in 4 types each with its own limitation, specification, and price.</p>
									<p><b>Tag 1</b> is based on the ISO14443A standard, and is mainly used to store very small types of data such as website URLs. Its capacity is 454 bytes, without any possibility of modification. It’s communication speed is on average 106 kbit/s and is regarded as the cheapest tag amongst the. Due to its age, tag 1 is regarded to be the slowest chip amongst the 4. Its main function is to only Read or Write.</p>
									<p><b>Tag 2</b> roughly follows tag 1’s standard, ISO14443A. It’s main difference lies on the memory. The capacity of a Tag 2 chip varies from 48 bytes to 2 kbytes. The price also varies depending on the capacity within the chip the larger capacity, the more expensive it would be. The speed of a Tag 2 chip mirrors a Tag 1 chip of, 106  kbit/s. Even if the price ranges depending on capacity, the tag 2 chip is still also regarded as one of the cheapest compared to the 4, and the better option due to its flexibility compared to Tag 1. Compared to the Tag 1, the Tag 2 is able to Read or Write, and Read only.</p>
									<p><b>Tag 3</b> is where a difference is clearly shown not only by specifications but by function as well. This tag is based on the FeliCa system and has an available memory of 2 kbytes. It’s communication speed between devices is 212 kbit/s  which doubles when compared to Tag’s 1 and 2. Similar to tag 1 and 2 its function can be used to either Read or Write, or Read-only. Due to its high capacity the price of a Tag 3 is regarded as the highest amongst the 4 types.</p>
									<p><b>Tag 4</b> brings the best of both worlds between tags 1, 2, and 3. It is compatible with ISO14443A and B standards, and has a memory of 32 kbytes. It’s communication speed varies depending on model from 106 kbit/s to 424 kbit/s. It’s functionality mirrors tags 2 and 3 with, Read or Write, or Read-only. The main selling point of a Tag 4 is in the price and security. The cost of a tag 4 is considerably cheaper than a tag 3, and the encryption provided is a lot safer.</p>

									<h3>NFC encoder system.</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>NFC chips are comprised of 3 main components;
									<ul><li>Microchip: To process data requests and store small amount of data</li>
									<li>Antenna: To send and receive signals</li>
									<li>Something that holds it together: Thin piece of plastic.</li></ul>
									By turning each phone into an NFC encoder, this give users control over how many cards they have in circulation. During the encoding process cards will be locked - cutting of any chance of external manipulation.
									The app will also have logging functionality that provides users with basic usage metric about their cards regarding frequency of use, average daily spend and more.
									The data stored on the cards will be a secure pointer to our web servers, where information accessed will include;
									<ul><li>Name</li>
									<li>Card Type</li>
									<li>Balance</li></ul>
									User Application will be using Java / C / C++
									Java in Android supports the Tag Dispatch system where an NFC tag is discovered, categorised based on data in the tag and starts an app based on categorisation.
									Android has an NFC API for android that can be used to interact with the NFC module in the phone chip. iOS also has a similar framework for NFC development called CoreNFC, announced in 2017.
									</p>

									<h3>Why java?</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>Java is the official language used to develop android applications and for good reasons too. These reasons include; it being easy to learn, platform-independent and java is also object-oriented (IBM, 2018). Furthermore, the Android SDK (Software Development Kit) is written in Java and includes many useful resources for app development (Android Developers, 2018) such as; a debugger, standard Java libraries including data structure, maths, graphics, and networking libraries. And more importantly Android libraries which is particularly useful for app development. As well as sample codes and tutorials.
									Aside from Java being easy to learn due to the abundant availability of resources it is also one of the most human readable languages (Conder and Darcey, 2010). In that beginners are able to pick up Java easier and more quickly compared to other programming languages.
									The human readable Java source files are converted to bytecode via Java compilers, the codes are converted in order to allow the Java Virtual Machine to execute the compiled code. This is different to other programming languages in that they are not as portable. For example, the Dalvik Virtual Machine which is used to run Android applications allows the app to run regardless of what device, it could be any Android running device.
									</p>
									<p>Object oriented programming or OOP is a form of programming language that depends on defining data structures and its functions as ‘objects’ (Beal, 2018). These objects that contain both data and function can interact with other objects if programmed to do so. There are many advantages of Java being a OOP language, a couple include; a modular structure which makes it easy to hide implementation details when one wishes to define abstract datatypes. Another advantage for having a modular structure is that it is easier to maintain for instances where there are issues, in that part of the system can be updated without having to make large-scale changes (Puri, 2017). Several other benefits include; faster development, can be easily modified by the programmer and better productivity (Puri, 2017).
									All in all, there are many reasons as to why using Java to program Android applications would be a good if not the ideal language to use. It is also the most sought out programming language by employers.

									<h3>Why React Javascript</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>React JavaScript is a programming language invented by Facebook back at 2013. Its popularity grew over the years through its user-friendly and app-friendly designs. Currently it is well known for delivering great performance, with internal flexibility. This means that applications developed using React JavaScript and its interface are ‘Live’ and ‘Hot Reloading’. ‘Live’ and ‘Hot Reloading’ gives the freedom for developers to make changes on the spot while the application runs beside it. This eliminates the need to turn any device on and off to make changes.
									</p>
									<p>One of the main downfalls of React JavaScript is its needy requirements. Compared to other development teams which utilize languages such as Objective-C or Swift for the IOS platform, or Java and Kotlin for Android, React JavaScript is known to be the most time consuming amongst the rest. Ultimately this also relates to the amount of work the team will have to invest, and the cost.
									Due to its friendly cross-platform abilities we have chosen React JavaScript as our end-stage language to integrate the public transport application into other platforms such as IOS. However by adopting React JavaScript, we believe extra blockades will appear due to its time and cost. It’s simple user interface also allows the developer to view the applications internal script, which makes it easier to locate and resolve errors within the system.
									</p>
									</div>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h3>Initial Stage</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>This stage revolves around the creation of our prototype chip in hopes to gain investors to fund future stages, and hopefully a small implementation into certain rural areas within Australia for testing purposes.
									For this stage we will be programming an Android application which will be used on mobile phones. Recent developments in the hand held industry has led to an implementation of NFC chips inside phones which we can use in conjunction to our application. This would mean that people are able to touch on and off with their phones without the need of taking out a card. Ultimately however we would opt to export the data from the phone into an NFC chip which would placed inside a card.
									The type of NFC tag used for this stage would be Tag 3. The reason for using Tag 3 despite the cost and reduced encryption system is the flexibility it provides across multiple readers. Ultimately however on a large scale we would want to use a Tag 4 instead.
									</p>
									<p>The programming language we would use to develop our application and code our chips is Java. The reason behind using Java is that it is known to be very friendly with Android applications. The limitation to this is that we would be heavily limited to the Android platform alone compared to IOS systems. The main reason we chose to produce an Android application is simply due to the cost of publicly releasing an app on the store. An apple product would have to pay 100$, whereas an Android product could be either free or paid for a maximum total of 25$.
									Once a functional prototype is produced we would request a permit from the government to showcase and test the product within small rural areas. Results found from a user rating survey the best and worst areas to test are;
									</p>
									<p><h5>Best - Perth (Transperth)</h5>
									Survey results shown from The Age shows that Transperth has the highest ratings in terms of service, timing, and system when compared to the other 5 metro systems. The reason we chose to test with the best condition is to identify whether the system can be implemented easily and whether there would be any complications using the new application or card. The questions we ask here are;
									<ul><li>Are there any errors users come across?</li>
									<li>Is it easy to implement the system in the area within the best possible setting?</li>
									<li>Are there any errors topping up?</li></ul>
									</p>
									<p><h5>Worst - Melbourne (Metro Train)</h5>
									Survey results produced from The Age shows that metro trains had one of the lowest ratings in terms of service, timing, and system. The reason we chose to test within its worst parameters was to identify whether the card would work under extreme stress of multiple usage. The questions we ask are;
									<ul><li>Are there errors after using it multiple times?</li>
									<li>Are there errors topping up?</li>
									<li>Are there errors touching On or Off?</li>
									<li>Are there errors commuting via multiple vehicles; such as Trains / Busses / Trams?</li>
									The location we would prefer as mentioned should be a rural spot however with  some good amount of activity such as Geelong. The reason behind finding rural  areas is to avoid any major mishaps if errors were to occur.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h3>End stage and support</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>With the assumption of success within the initial stage, the end stage goal would be to expand our application and card usage towards other platforms such as IOS or a website. The two major differences that will change would be towards the type of programming language we would use, and the type of tag. The tag used within this stage is the Tag 4 due to its cheaper nature, and higher level of security. The language used would be React Native Javascript which is compatible across a variety of platforms.</p>
