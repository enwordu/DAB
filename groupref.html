									I believe that the group could have done a lot better if communication were smoother. Throughout the assignment members of the team would fall silent for extended periods of time which would instil worry amongst other peers. However after receiving external help from the lecturer and tutor the group was able to function better. Aside from communication I believe the group would have been better if members had more drive to completion and workload. Members would sit idle awaiting instructions.
									Aside from bumps and cracks throughout the timeline, this group has had a fantastic start to the assignment by completing certain tasks over the holidays, primarily the topics and interviews, with many thanks to Edward for donating his time on a holiday to be our target Interview.

									<h3>Daniel</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>I think that our performance as a group could have been better. Communication channels were not used as much as they should have been during the initial stage of this project. Having said that, this improved drastically towards the end making project completion easier. 
									To the detriment of the team, members often acted as free agents completing only assigned tasks and not showing any further initiative to get involved and help others. I believe that we could have finished this assignment sooner had this hindrance not been present.
									Credit to the team, and Ed, in regard to early efforts to get as much of the project completed as possible (Interview and study session). Consequently, we were put in a good position early on.

									<p>First of all, our group is very diverse both in regards to culture and in regards to religion, I am happy that we all got to work together on this project as it helped me better understand my course mates and some of the limitations they have. My first observation was a communication gap as a group member did not have English as his first language which led to minor delays and making the group have to put in more effort. Also, another group member is not an information technology or computer science student so we had some issues trying to get her to do the required work.
									Daniel and Davin are both information technology students whose interest and drive I appreciate a lot and also made things go a lot smoother than they otherwise would have gone. The team was dedicated and willing to meet outside school hours which was a first for me as my group in other courses do not carry group work beyond the classroom. My major contribution to the group was the design of the webpage which also helped me tune up my HTML skills and I enjoyed it.

									<h3>Maryam</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>I believe that I could have shown some more initiative and expressed more ideas to the group and I do regret not being more involved. However I have learnt no one really judges and I shouldn’t be afraid to voice out opinions. 
									This being my first group assignment and also being the only person from a different program I did feel slightly intimidated and didn’t know what to expect. I came into this assignment assuming that I would be easy to work with if simply completed tasks given to me.
									This was not the case and overall I have learnt that being more vocal (but not annoyingly vocal) would have been the ideal way to work in a group.

									<h3>Benjamin</h3>
									<div class="box">
									<p>The group was good, we started working on the assignment early and had most of it done by the second week due to careful planning and having a many individuals also given tasks were completed before the allocated deadline which ensured the early completion of the assignment.
									Without clear communications we had challenges during the initial challenges, i for one had issues with my phone which meant issues with whatsapp but once each group member joined Discord communications have been better.
									But generally with good leadership, careful planning and good communication within the group, have been the key factors that have ensured.

									<p>Through the group work for assignment 2 , i realised that the most significant thing for team work is well-communication. Using discord and mobile as our communication channel makes us to work effectively and way easier. As every group members know what they should do, what their tasks are and they participate actively, our group project could be completed well.

									<p><h5>What went well?</h5>
									What really kept us on top was the planning that went into the completing the report and beginning the project early. A fair bit of work was completed in our scheduled study session at the library on 30/08/2018.
									Due to the different types of members within a good sized team we  were able to divide certain tasks depending on interest. This aided with a better final result.
									<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
									Although we had clear communication channels established, the level of communication in the group could have been better, especially when one could not attend a meeting.
									Secondly taking initiative to complete tasks would benefit the end result and workload of the team.
									The team fell flat early on because we didn’t follow up on progress from members nearly as much as we should of. The unspoken expectation was that we would all complete our work and contribute as required which, ultimately, was not the case.
									<h5>At least one thing that was surprising.</h5>
									How quickly people responded upon the threat of being moved out of the group. This realisation is quite disappointing because it involved external intervention from our tutor and lecturer. 
									The level of expectation in terms of quality and quantity of work varies from different members. Equality is definitely hard to enforce.
									<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h5>
									That although we have a common goal, our expectations vary from member to member in regards to communication, work load, quality of work and quantity. The trick is to be able to manage those expectations by clearly defining roles and what is expected.
									<h5>How well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment.</h5>
									Apart from initialising the repo and uploading required materials for the website. The github log is is pretty spare. Instead we opted to collaborate on Google docs, preparing both our report and the content for our website there. The document link for the report is <a href="#">here</a> and shows our extensive version history.
									In relation to our communication we used 2 methods;
									<ol><li>We began using whatsapp but found that its capabilities were a bit limiting for what we needed to do.<li>
									<li>Finally, we landed on Discord for posting relevant information regarding the assignment, Interviewing Ed, posting documents and other things. The link to our discord server can be found <a href="#">here</a>.
