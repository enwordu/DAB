											<h3>Emmanuel Nwordu</h3>
											<p>Hello people, my name is Emmanuel Nwordu and i am an undergraduate student of RMIT University, 
											i come from the southern part of Nigeria where we have rich oil fields and also the best crude oil in the world known as Bonny Light Crude.
											I love playing strategic games that help 
											increase the rate at which my brain
											computer processes data, chess mostly, but at times i dive into the vast world of computer strategy games.
											I started out on my I.T. adventure trying my best to get as much knowledge as i could including networking, database administration and web programming, as i always wanted to

											<h3>Davin Ie</h3>
											<p>Hello!
											My name’s Davin or I go by Dave. I come from Indonesia which is located just north of Australia and I lived in the city called Jakarta. My family is of Asian-Chinese
											background and holds tradition in high regard. My hobbies involve watching movies, especially comedy such as; Brooklyn Nine-Nine, 
											or Community, and playing games, some titles i’ve been enjoying are; Undertale, Dead by Daylight, and Starcraft 2. 
											My experience with IT is quite scarce currently after all this is my first year into Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. 
											In terms of skills i’ve got a basic understanding of HTML and some experience into Java. The world of IT to me is 
											quite broad and I honestly am unable to pinpoint a certain category in which i enjoy, that said i’ve loved every aspect of it and is eager to  learn more.

											<h3>Daniel Dominique</h3>
											<p>Hi all, my name is Daniel Dominique and a first gen Australian.
											In my spare time I enjoy building computers. I enjoy all aspects of the process from; designing what I want to build,
											sourcing parts for the build, building the computer and selling it! I first started building computers from need.
											My interest in IT is with the role that it plays in the lives of users.
											My experience in the field is limited, having only dabbled with HTML
											and CSS during my last assignment when creating my website. I have also begun to learn java and python.

											<h3>Min Chul Shin</h3>
											<p>Hello everybody! My name is Min chul shin. I came from south korea, seoul which is the capital city of south korea and I can speak English, 
											Korean, some Chinese(Cantonese) . I am currently in my first year of Bachelor of IT and really enjoying it so far! I have got many hobbies 
											involves playing football and playing games. Apart from that, I also love to listen music, watch movies and shopping.
											In terms of interest in IT and my personal experiences. I was very interested in IT as the significance of IT has been dramatically increased these days and it becomes such a vital 
											thing to make society changed. So that I wanted to learn and know about IT more like how vast information exchanges, how it solves the problem. Before I take the IT course, I was not aware
											of IT things and I haven’t learnt any of this topic so I thought myself it is going to be great opportunity to boost up my ability since I can challenge to many things.</p>

											<h3>Benjamin Kiptoon</h3>
											<p>Hello everyone, my name is Benjamin and i’m currently in my first year of Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I’m Kenyan and a kalenjin and 
											I speak three languages; English, Kiswahili and Kalenjin. I am an artist, and I love to draw portrait images. Aside from drawing I enjoy watching movies and listening to music.
											i love IT because of its complexity and vastness and also how it involves technology and how its used to solve world problems, also its a challenging career which is the best when you want 
											to improve yourself i have little to no experience in IT, i mean i have always been fascinated with technology i even watch a lot of videos on technology  but i have never took
											initiative and actually really understand it, i did take an online course on creating HTML documents that i didn’t finish but it help me code my website from scratch which is terrible but its my first actual work

											<h3>Maryam M. Aboobucker</h3>
											<p>YOO, I’m Maryam or Maz and I am of Sri Lankan ethnicity, born and raised in the west side of Melbourne (aka the best side). 
											I do speak some Tamil and Spanish, I also teach Arabic. I am a doing the Bachelor of Applied Science (Psychology) at RMIT and
											love it so far. I’ve got a bunch of hobbies, some include; painting, gymming, making music, impulsive shopping and hoarding irrelevant things. 
											In terms of IT and my skills, a child born in 2010 would probably know more about computers than me. I struggle to watch movies *totally legally cough cough* without also 
											giving my computer aids. The reason why I chose to take this course was to challenge myself and to learn the basics of IT in attempt for me to cope or adapt with changing times.

											<h3>Emmanuel Nwordu</h3>
											<p><h5>MBTI-ISTJ. Introversion. Sensing. Thinking. Judging.</h5>
											From this tests,it appears i am introverted, observant and more of a listener than a talker. They also show that i am critical, analytical and optimistic.
											<p></p>
											<h5>LEARNING STYLE. Auditory</h5>			I deduce from the interpretations that i will be more suited to lead a team, make decisions for or be a part of the team organization structure.
											<p></p>
											<h5>IPIP-BFFM - 37.62.21.72.46</h5>
											This is the big five personality test and the numbers represented above are scales out of 100 for extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness 
											and intellect respectively. When forming a team i should be aware of my responsibilities and my ability to be analytical as this will be an important factor, also 
											my ability to be careful and diligent as indicated by the BFFM will be essential to maximize team output.
											</p>

											<h3>Davin Ie</h3>
											<p>
											<h5>Myers Briggs Test</h5>
											My results on the Myers Briggs Test indicates that I am ‘The  Consul’ (ESFJ-A). This means that I value teamwork and comradery rather than individualism, and I would try to ensure 
											a fair distribution of workload amongst the members. Personality wise I am quite shy and timid at any initial stage of interaction with another individual, however after getting to know each other and spending some time together, I would find it easier to be more open towards my peers.
											<p></p>
											<h5>What is my Learning Style Test</h5>
											For my learning styles I was classed into three categories; 40% Visual Learner, 40% Auditory Learner, and a subclass of 20% Tactile or Kinesthetic Learner. This meant that I can quickly understand something better when I both see and hear instead of the counterpart 
											of studying quietly. In addition to aid in understanding the topic better I also am able to learn by conducting practicals. Although i strive on learning quickly by communication and sight, my results from the Myers Briggs test points out that there is a limit to 
											how many people can be within a team for me, that limit is 5. Anymore can cause unnecessary distraction which could potentially hinder my ability to work.
											<p></p>
											<h5>The Big Five Personality Test (O.C.E.A.N)</h5>
											The results for my Big Five Personality Test, also known as OCEAN in short, indicates that i’m quite disciplined with myself and promote a stress-free environment. This can be very beneficial to the team due to my eagerness to work hard from the get-go instead of 
											procrastinating to the last few weeks or days. Aside from keeping a structured plan, I also am able to make rational decisions by my calm nature instead of allowing stress to burden me.
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3>Daniel Dominique</h3>
											<p>
											<h5>Myers-Briggs:</h5>
											I have been classified as having an INTJ personality which is a part of the “Rational” family. In a nutshell, my decision making comes from a place of measured thought, relying on facts, observations and objective truths to make an informed decision. It also means that I can be, at times, a little hard to get to know.
											<p></p>
											<h5>Learning Style Test:</h5>
											My results were: 25% Auditory, 35% Visual and 40% tactile. This means that my I learn best through practical application of concepts I would otherwise learn in from a book or speaker. I find that I gain experience regardless of whether something is done correctly or not and I learn from it.
											<p></p>
											<h5>Creativity Test:</h5>
											My top 3 metrics are: Complexity, Curiosity and Connection.
											Complexity is “the ability to carry large quantities of information and be able to manipulate and manage the relationships between such information” [3, para. 1]. Curiosity is “the desire to change or improve things that everyone else accepts as the norm.” [3, para. 1]. Connection is “the ability to make 
											connections between things that don't initially have an apparent connection.” [3, para. 1]
											<p></p>
											<h5>What I bring to the table:</h5>
											My objective decision making abilities make me a sound choice for input on any major group decision without causing too much group friction. However, I should pay particular attention to sharing my opinions freely and respectfully with others whilst also making sure that others are afforded the same courtesy. 
											</p>

											<h3>Min Chul Shin</h3>
											<p><h5>The Myer-Briggs Test - The Campaigner (ENFP-T)</h5>
											<h5>What’s Your Learning Style Test - Visual Learner</h5>
												<ul><li>Auditory: 25%</li>
												<li>Visual: 45%</li>
												<li>Tactile: 30%</li></ul>
											<h5>The Big Five Factors Test</h5>
												<ul><li>Openness to Experience: 36%</li>
												<li>Conscientiousness: 45%</li>
												<li>Extraversion: 90%</li>
												<li>Agreeableness: 27%</li>
												<li>Natural Reactions: 20%</li></ul>
											These results clearly show what my strength and weaknesses are, so that it gives me the opportunity to look back myself and recognize what action I should take for 
											improving myself. And moreover, through these tests I could realize of myself clearly so that when I do something with others, I will take action more carefully
											Since I identified deeply about my personality and myself.. I know what kind of skills and personality I need so that when I form a 
											team or group, I will take the mature behavior and when I say something to others, I will seriously take a responsibility. Eventually my behavior will be one step improved through these tests.
											This tests are giving me the clear section of myself which can be merits or drawbacks, so It will make 
											me think and act carefully every time. And I will rather think others first than thinking myself.
											</p>

											<h3>Benjamin Kiptoon</h3>
											<p><h5>Myers-Briggs Test</h5>
											The results i won’t say are 100% accurate but in many ways it has a truth to it, i am introverted and yes i do have a problem with 
											communicating with people a lot i am more observant than initiative unlike what the test says and also i don’t really rely on my feelings to make decisions but i do consider other people's feelings when i make decisions that in a way hurt their feelings.
											<p></p>
											<h5>PsychCentral</h5>
											The results are that i have Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism and Openness to Experience Traits.
											And yet again another test says am an extrovert when am not one, i mean if am to go out i must be sure i know 90% of the people i meet.but yes the rest of the results are true.
											<p></p>
											<h5>Learning Style Test</h5>
											My result scores were Auditory: 25% Visual: 45% Tactile: 30% which means am more of a visual learner,
											which is true i believe you learn more but by observing, i also have a fairly good photographic memory, and of all my tests this is the most accurate because i usually remember a lot just by visualising.
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3>Maryam M. Aboobucker</h3>
											<p><h5>Myers-Briggs Test: The Mediator INFP</h5>
											The results of these tests are surprisingly accurate, according to the results of the Myers Briggs test I may experience instances 
											where I’d like to block out the external world and recline to my own for longer periods of time than normal. I strongly agree with and relate to this tendency as I have experienced episodes of the “hermit mode”.
											<p></p>
											<h5>Learning Style Test: Visual Learner</h5>
											My Learning Style has always been visual, during primary school when we had to learn new words I tended to learn definitions better by 
											drawing the word and giving it a story rather than just memorising.
											<p></p>
											<h5>The Enneagram: The Individualist (Type 4)</h5>
											The Enneagram is something I’m very interested in which is why I chose to take this particular test. And the result of it in my opinion is more accurate
											than the Myers-Briggs test simply because I was provided with more information to which I related to. According to the enneagram I tend to let feelings get in the way of work.
											These results indicate that overall, I tend to work creatively. I may therefore be able to assist my group with creative inputs.

										<h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="posts">
										<article>
											<h3>Emmanuel Nwordu</h3>
											<p><h4>Software Development Manager</h4>
											<h5>Common elements</h5>
											All group members have programming languages in common as this is a basic skill which cuts across the I.T industry in 
											relation to communicating with computers, another skill that is very important though less pronounced in some careers is data manipulation as this deals with how the data is transformed into information.
											<p></p>
											<h5>Differences</h5>
											This group is unique in the sense that everyone has a different ideal job which arises from the job specification point of view
											<p></p>
											<h5>Similarity and/or differences to career plans amongst group members</h5>
											Although all group members have different job titles there is no clear cut line of independence due to the relative tendency of the group to software development. 
											The only outlier is the graphics designer who can also be part of the software development life cycle but with modern trends is usually limited to web interface design. 
											Also my job includes management which involves demonstrating leadership but also may be bourne by the years spent in the I.T. industry.
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3>Davin Ie</h3>
											<p><h4>Senior Java Developer</h4>
											<h5>Common elements</h5>
											It was quite surprising to know that various jobs require similar programming languages such as; Java / HTML, and to some degree certain frameworks that tie with each language. 
											Although I believe programming languages has always had the motivation and idea to become ‘one’ in a sense that there is a high possibility that in the 
											future there can possibly be only one programming language that is user friendly across all platforms.
											Aside from IT related skills, general skills also vary however surprisingly communication is one of the most seeked trait. 
											As mentioned I value teamwork and comradery with high regards.
											<p></p>
											<h5>Differences</h5>
											Aside from languages it was interesting to see that different jobs used different frameworks such as EJB or Spring. 
											Although they might not use similar frameworks for their respective programming languages, they still however have a type of framework listed  that they have to master before obtaining the job.
											<p></p>
											<h5>Similarity and/or differences to career plans amongst group members</h5>
											One aspect that jumped out was ‘Experience’. The main IT jobs across all boards seemed to require some time in the field. 
											With that in mind i’m unsure whether the experience within university counts towards obtaining the job, or if they require work-related experience instead. 
											Another point that I found interesting was the basic skill requirement of ‘Creative’. Some of our jobs such as mine or 
											Daniels, do not require us to be creative, however other jobs that Maryam or Hayden wishes to pursue, will require some level of creativity. 
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3>Daniel Dominique</h3>
											<p><h4>Full Stack Developer</h4>
											<h5>Common elements</h5>
											Majority of the team member have expressed interest in Software development in some way shape or form. Of these, all members wanted to learn java, SQL and front-end programming languages.
											Other members expressed interest in Graphic design
											<p></p>
											<h5>Differences</h5>
											While many of use required the same types of programming languages, the APIs and frameworks we listed are quite different.
											The toolset for Developers differs greatly to Graphic designers who would use Image editing programs from companies like Corel, Adobe and more.
											<p></p>
											<h5>Similarity and/or differences to career plans amongst group members</h5>
											The jobs that Emmanuel,Davin and I have selected have clear scope for career advancement based on experience. Hayden on the other and has selected a job that can be performed on a freelance basis making his career goals very flexible.
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3>Min Chul Shin</h3>
											<h4>iOS Mobile Developer</h4>
											<p><h5>Common elements</h5>
											Every group members has the required of programming language skill in common which is obviously required in IT. and also various job required similar skills such as JAVA, SQL. in addition, the one of the most significant general skill for many jobs is communication (team work).
											<p></p>
											<h5>Similarity and/or differences to career plans amongst group members</h5>
											Since everyone has different personalities and characteristic, it makes the differences in our ideal job and our career plan. As i want to be a app developer, i have an interests in programming i will keep attempting to get programming knowledge as many as i can, also want work with IT experts. Ultimately working in the IT field would be my plan
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3>Benjamin Kiptoon</h3>
											<p><h4>Cloud Architect</h4>
											<h5>Common elements</h5>
											Each person has the need to have knowledge in front end programing languages which(HTML and CSS) 
											also back-end programing languages like Java. also database languages like SQL are common with all group members 
											With common general skills like communication, problem solving and teamwork
											<p></p>
											<h5>Differences</h5>
											My career requires the use of different programing languages like .NET, C extended and PHP also thee use of LINUX 
											<p></p>
											<h5>Similarity and/or differences to career plans amongst group members</h5>
											The difference in careers depends on the different personalities and interests it also 
											depends on peer influence and the job market. I have always had a thing for the cloud which made me opt for a career that deals with the same.
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3>Maryam M. Aboobucker</h3>
											<p><h4>Graphics Designer</h4>
											<h5>Common elements</h5>
											The ability to use HTML, CSS and or Java well seem to be the main commonality found within all of our ideal jobs. Employers look for coding as skill not only 
											because it is the foundation of web but it can also be used in a variety of different ways for a variety of different roles.
											Even for jobs outside the realm of IT, for example, marketing via emails can benefit by understanding that coding can be used
											to improve the look of emails and attract customers (Using HTML and CSS available with email marketing services). 
											<p></p>
											<h5>Differences</h5>
											<p>The differences among our jobs lies within the different abilities required to achieve the job’s obligations. </p>
											<p></p>
											<h5>Similarity and/or differences to career plans amongst group members</h5>
											The differences in our ideal jobs and career plans could be due to our differing personalities, interests and learning styles. 
											For example, Daniel is a tactile learner and builds his own custom computers and sells them, by pursuing a career in becoming 
											full stack developer he is able to bring his engineering and business qualities to good use. As opposed to myself, I am a visual 
											learner and have an interest in art making as well as working with like-minded people and have decided that graphic design would be my pathway to follow.
